Theano in Action to implement Deep Learning Algorithm

Deep Learning Framework:
1.Deep Convolutional Network
2.Deep Belief Networks(Restricted Boltzmann Machines) - unsupervised generative pre-training of stacked RBMs followed by supervised fine-tuning
3.Auto Encoders, Denoising Autoencoders - description of autoencoders
4.Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders - easy steps into unsupervised pre-training for deep nets

Others:
1.HMC Sampling - hybrid Monte Carlo Sampling with scan()
2.Contrative auto-encoders
3.Semantic Parsing of Speech using Recurrent Net
4.LSTM network for sentiment analysis
